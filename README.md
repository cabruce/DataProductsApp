# Getting Started

This repository contains the server.R and ui.R files corresponding to the UN World Population Prospections population pyramid reproduction application. This app was built with shiny and R, and hosted on the shiny server.

To run this app, the user simply needs to select the requested year from the list provided. The expected population pyramid then generates for the year selected.
