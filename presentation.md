How is the population predicted?
========================================================

- The United Nations World Population Prospects estimates the population of each country up to 85 years into the future. 

- Using a combination of fertility estimates and mortality estimates, the population of both sexes is estimated. 
 
- One method of displaying this information is a population pyramid, a graphical illustration that shows the age distribution of a population for both genders. 

- Population pyramids can be used to observe the increases and decreases of birth and death rates over time.

Displaying Data Using Shiny
========================================================

- This application will use data from the UN World Population prospects to build population pyramids for the predicted population 25, 50, and 75 years in the future. 

- Currently, the data is displayed for the United States only, but it would be easy to add other countries.


Predicition the World Population by Age is Essential for Generational Accounting
========================================================

- This app will be particularly useful in predicting the population of children and the elderly.

- Data like this is crucial because it helps both public and private organizations predict the necessary allocation of resources in the future.
